					<p>This is a discord bot written in python with discord.py. It uses the openai api to communicate with gpt-3. You can use it yourself by creating your own discord application and openai account. Sad that some companys have started using openai for their own profit.</p>

					<a class="mainlistElem" href="https://github.com/vanten-s/frmWrk">frmWrk</a>
					<p>frmWrk is a custom made framework that only works with HTTP 1.1. It's made in python and only uses sockets to communicate with the client. Im not very proud of this but it was made in 10 days for mattekollo 2022 project presentation. It's takes an object oriented approach and the user has to do a lot of the work but the framework does some of the heavy lifting.</p>
