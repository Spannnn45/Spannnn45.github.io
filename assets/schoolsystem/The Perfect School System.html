<h2 id="the-problems">The problems</h2>
<h3 id="the-impact-on-the-current-school-system-from-capitalist-forces">The
impact on the current school system from capitalist forces</h3>
<p>The post-industrial school teaches people to be good workers. To
listen to your boss and not have any ideas. It doesn’t promote thinking
about how to change society and the problems with capitalism. We should
be teached how to think critically and to form our own ideas. We get
teached what the capitalists want us to get teached. That is to sit
quietly on your place and do what your boss tells you to do without
question.</p>
<h3 id="the-control-that-social-media-has-on-the-current-student">The
control that social media has on the current student</h3>
<p>Social media in the 21st century has destroyed students. It has made
everyone so much more connected yet distant that we don’t recognise each
other anymore. We are one person on social media and one in real life.
According to <a href="https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751">an
experiment in 2018</a>, social media can make us feel lonely. Feeling
lonely isn’t good for a student’s mental health. Schools should instead
focus on the mental health of the student and should offer free therapy
and solutions for people with bad mental health.</p>
<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>Homework is another problem. It makes student’s minds constantly full
of their homework. It makes the student’s stressed and worsens their
mental health.</p>
<h2 id="why-its-a-problem">Why it’s a problem</h2>
<h3 id="society">Society</h3>
<h4 id="inequality">Inequality</h4>
<p>Capitalists would thrive of a workforce made out of people who only
follow instructions. This in turn would lead to more inequality as the
workforce knows only to get used by the capitalist. The proletariat
would suffer for generations to come as the next generation comes and
experiences the same thing.</p>
<h4 id="suffering">Suffering</h4>
<p>In school the students would suffer. They would be lonely and
depressed. This would in turn cause the working class to be less
productive and we would have another economic crash.</p>
<h2 id="the-ideal-school">The ideal school</h2>
<h3 id="homework-1">Homework</h3>
<p>Homework would put extra stress on the students. Homework is
volountary but still always an option. The homework is also not exactly
identical to what you did at school but still not harder. If you didn’t
remember how you did from school or if you are working form home you
should have a walktrough of some of the problems.</p>
<h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>
<p>Classes is always based on skill instead of age. You also have
multiple parallell classes where you can choose which one you’re in as
long as they want you there. The class you are moving to is going to
hold a democratic vote with 3 alternatives: Allow, Disallow and neutral.
The vote is going to be anonymous and you have to get a 60% super
majority. If the class wishes to kick out a student they can also do
that with a 60% super majority. Each class would then be naturally form
to be like minded. If a group of students want to create a new class
they can do so whenever they like.</p>
<h3 id="democracy">Democracy</h3>
<p>Every student should be aware about the schools decision if they want
to. They should also have a vote in every decision. This helps the
students feel heard and wanted. The vote would be done by one person per
class and the class would first have to agree on the issue and then the
represantative would lay their vote. This would take place after school
and it’s volountary.</p>
<h3 id="volountary">Volountary</h3>
<p>Every student has the right to go to school if they so choose. At the
same time it’s volountary, just like many other things, to appear to
every class. If the student do not wish to show up, they don’t have to.
Of course you have to have some knowledge from a previous lesson to get
to the next one but instead of a linear learning you can watch online if
there is anything you’ve missed. This also makes it required for the
teacher to record their lessons.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h3>
<p>Every student can choose what difficulty they study at. This helps
them get adjusted and if you’re slow you can learn slower and the school
allows for that.</p>
<h3 id="relevance">Relevance</h3>
<p>The students can always lear everything that is required for
everyone. This includes but is not limited to how our democracy works,
how to pay your taxes, how to get a job and more. This helps the student
get happy later in life.</p>
<h3 id="fun">Fun</h3>
<p>The school day is fun but long. The student doesn’t view school as a
bad thing and thinks it fun to be there. The lessons will always be made
for the student to have fun learning. This way you can make the students
want to stay longer and make the day longer. The students still learn
only slower than before but because they have longer days this will not
matter.</p>
<h3 id="phones">Phones</h3>
<p>Phones can distract the student. Student’s are not allowed to use
phones except for the phones deal’t out by the school which only allows
you to see the schedule for the day and basic information like if a
teacher is sick or similar.</p>
<h3 id="bullying">Bullying</h3>
<p>The school has a tight grip on bullying. No bullying is allowed in
the school and punishments are harsh for the ones that bully. If a
teacher witnesses bullying or someone reports bullying then</p>
<h2 id="how-to-achivie-this">How to achivie this</h2>
<h3 id="the-wider-society">The wider society</h3>
<p>If the rest of society would get rid of the capitalist system then we
wouldn’t have capitalist forces affecting the school system. Social
media is also dependent on capitalism as it’s owned and funded by big
companies. These companies also make it harder to share socialist ideas
on social media by not recommending them to people. If we solve the rest
of society school would solve itself.</p>
