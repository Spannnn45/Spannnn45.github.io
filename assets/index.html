			<h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Old stuff</h3>
			<p>I'm was born and raised in Sweden and i was passionate about techology from an early age. 
				I started learning about trains at around 3 years old. 
				My programming career started with the lego mindstorms EV3. 
				At 7 years old i made a simple robot with it that could solve Rubiks cubes. 
				It was not that impressive considering it was just following instructions but im still proud over it. 
				At 9 i made my own computer which was pretty okay. 
				The only bad thing with it is the fact that i spent to little on my graphics card. 
				At 11 i designed my own CPU architecture. 
				It's very bad but it works so im not complaining. 
				I also implemented raymarching in unity, unfortunately i don't have the files left. 
				mi sona lili e toki pona!</p><br>
            <h3>What im currently doing</h3>
<p>I currently use Arch on my laptop, Arch on my desktop and Debian on my Server. I mostly do small high level projects but sometimes I do small projects with a microcontroller. I'm not the best at communicating but I can pick up a new language pretty fast. Currently I am most comfortable with Python, Rust, Java and Javascript, less comfortable with C, C++, C# and GLSL/HLSL. I have never used most other languages.

			<h2>My projects</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a class="mainlistElem" href="https://github.com/vanten-s/gpt3-bot">gpt-3 bot</a>
					<p>This is a discord bot written in python with discord.py. 
						It uses the openai api to communicate with gpt-3. 
						You can use it yourself by creating your own discord application and openai account. 
						Its very fun to play with and you can also play music with it. 
						I made it with hacktail on github and he wrote the gpt-3 part and i wrote most of the bot. 
						This was made for mattekollo 2022 project presentation in about 5 days. 
						Sad that some companys have started using openai for their own profit.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a class="mainlistElem" href="https://github.com/vanten-s/frmWrk">frmWrk</a>
					<p>frmWrk is a custom made webserver that only works with HTTP 1.1. 
						It's made in python and only uses sockets to communicate with the client. 
						Im not very proud of this but it was made in 10 days for mattekollo 2022 project presentation. 
						It takes an object oriented approach and the user has to do a lot of the work but the webserver does some of the heavy lifting.</p>
					<p>Side note: this website uses frmWrk.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a class="mainlistElem" href="https://github.com/vanten-s/project-selector">project-selector</a>
					<p>project-selector is a side project for learning rust. 
						I got some help from my friend emcat but i did much of the work on my own.
						I still use it to quickly navigate to my project folders.
						It's the only one of my projects to use a config file and im pretty proud of it.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a class="mainlistElem" href="https://github.com/vanten-s/christmastree-leds">christmastree-leds</a>
					<p>christmastree-leds is a program for neopixel leds written in Arduino C++.
						It still includes an old version written a year ago for the previous christmas but the new version is the best.
						It includes four modes and you can set the hue of some of them.
